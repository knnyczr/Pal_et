# p4 - PAL-ET
### ABOUT
This is an app for developers and designers to learn about colors, and color relationships through palettes. The app will generate a palette from an API call, the user will be able to then add the palette to a public "collection" and/or print it to get a printed version of the palette.

When generating palettes, the user will also be able to lock in a color and hit randomize again, giving the user a new palette with the same locked color.
